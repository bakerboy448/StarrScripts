# StarrScripts

A curated collection of scripts to optimize and manage various functions related to Starr applications and associated tools.
Occasionally holds random useful scripts as well.
These scripts are designed to enhance functionality, improve management, and automate routine tasks.
All scripts are **Created By: [Bakerboy448](https://github.com/bakerboy448/) unless otherwise noted.**

**Warning**: Do not edit files on Windows that will be executed on Linux without ensuring the line-endings are set to `LF`.
This means that `CRLF` cannot be used in .sh scripts. Bash scripts will not execute properly and you will receive an
error.
